title: "Android Sign"
summary: Signs your APK or Android App Bundle before uploading it to Google Play Store.
description: |-
  Once you have uploaded your keystore file and provided your keystore credentials on the **Code Signing** tab of the Workflow Editor, the **Android Sign** Step signs your APK digitally. 
  Bitrise assigns Environment Variables to the uploaded file and credentials, and uses those in the respective fields of the **Android Sign** Step. 
  Once the Step runs, it produces a signed APK or App Bundle which will be used as the input value of the **App file path** field in the **Google Play Deploy** Step.   

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Add the **Android Sign** Step after a build Step in your deploy workflow.
  2. Upload the keystore file to the **Upload file** field on the **Code Signing** tab.
  3. Provide your keystore password, keystore alias and private key password to the relevant fields on the **Code Signing** tab.
  4. Run your build.


  ### Troubleshooting
  Make sure you have the **Android Sign** Step right after a build Steps but before **Deploy to Google Play** Step in your deploy workflow.
  If you wish to get your Android project signed automatically, use the **Android Sign** Step and do not set any gradle task for the signing, otherwise, the Step will fail.
